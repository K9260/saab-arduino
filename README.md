# Arduino Nano - Saab 9-5

I have a small Arduino Nano in my Saab that controls LED ring behind cigarette lighter and Bluetooth receiver for the radio.  

Arduino turns Bluetooth receiver on and also switches the radio to telephone mode.  

To use the telephone mode, it is required to make custom AUX connection to your radio.  

[Link to DIY AUX tutorial](http://saabworld.net/showthread.php?t=28000)  

The LED has 2 animations, one on startup and one running continuosly.  
When switched to Bluetooth mode, the LED will turn from green to pink.
